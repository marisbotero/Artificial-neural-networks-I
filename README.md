# Artificial Neural Networks


Artificial Neural Networks are a Deep Learning Tool to solve tasks. They were born decades ago but their popularity has been increased exponentially since last 10 years, specially when Google opened TensorFlow for public use. However, there is something missing in this equation. A generation of Data Scientist has born, using these tools all together to solve their specific problems. To do so, the majority of them rely on those frameworks and 'the magic behind them'
